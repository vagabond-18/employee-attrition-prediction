# 📊 Employee Attrition Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether an employee is likely to leave an organization using supervised machine learning classification techniques.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a major concern for organizations as it leads to increased hiring costs and loss of experienced talent.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict employee attrition based on demographic, work-related, and satisfaction-related features.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
- Total features: 35
- Target variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

---

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

---

## 🔁 Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and encoding  
3. Train-test split  
4. Feature scaling (where required)  
5. Model training  
6. Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 📈 Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: **~89%**
- Random Forest Accuracy: **~88%**

The models perform strongly on non-attrition cases, with scope for improving recall on attrition cases.
